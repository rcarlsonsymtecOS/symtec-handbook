  <main>
    <p>
      SymTec expects all employees to conduct themselves in a professional,
      ethical, and respectful manner at all times. These standards apply to
      behavior toward clients, coworkers, vendors, and the public.
    </p>

    <h2 id="5-1">5.1 Professional Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      Employees are expected to act with honesty, integrity, and professionalism
      in all work-related activities. Conduct that negatively affects the
      company’s reputation or operations may result in corrective action.
    </p>

    <h2 id="5-2">5.2 Attendance and Punctuality</h2>
    <p>
      Regular attendance and punctuality are essential to business operations.
      Employees are expected to report to work as scheduled and to notify their
      Team Lead as soon as possible if they will be late or absent.
    </p>

    <h2 id="5-3">5.3 Workplace Behavior</h2>
    <p>
      Inappropriate behavior, including abusive language, threats, violence,
      or disruptive conduct, will not be tolerated. SymTec is committed to
      maintaining a safe and respectful workplace.
    </p>

    <h2 id="5-4">5.4 Use of Company Property</h2>
    <p>
      Company property, including equipment, systems, and resources, must be
      used responsibly and primarily for business purposes. Unauthorized or
      improper use may result in disciplinary action.
    </p>

    <h2 id="5-5">5.5 Conflicts of Interest</h2>
    <p>
      Employees must avoid situations in which personal interests conflict,
      or appear to conflict, with the interests of SymTec. Any potential
      conflicts of interest should be disclosed to management.
    </p>

    <p>
      Violations of these standards may result in corrective or disciplinary
      action, up to and including termination of employment.
