      greatest asset. Our success is built from having our company values instilled in each of us as we show
      our dedication, innovation, and hard work in taking care of each other and our customers.

    <p>
      This Employee Handbook is designed to help you understand our company mission, values, policies,
      procedures, and your rights and responsibilities as an employee.
    </p>

    <h2 id="1-2">1.2 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Handbook is designed to acquaint you with SymTec and provide you with information about working
      conditions, benefits, and policies affecting your employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information contained in this Handbook applies to all employees of SymTec. Following the policies
      described in this Handbook is considered a condition of continued employment. However, nothing in this
      Handbook alters an employee’s status. The contents of this Handbook shall not constitute nor be construed
      as a promise of employment or as a contract between the Company and any of its employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with the provisions of this Handbook.
      It is our objective to provide you with a constructive work environment conducive to both personal and
      professional growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in open and transparent communication. If you have questions or need clarification on any
      aspect of this handbook or your employment, please reach out to the administrative team.
    </p>

    <h2 id="1-3">1.3 New or Changes in Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Handbook supersedes all previous employee handbooks and memos that may have been issued from time
      to time on subjects covered in this Handbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, since our business and our organization are subject to change, we reserve the right to interpret,
      change, suspend, cancel, or dispute with or without notice all or any part of our policies, procedures,
      and benefits at any time. We will notify all employees of these changes.
    </p>

    <h2 id="1-4">1.4 Employment Applications</h2>
    <p>
      We rely upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application and the accuracy of
      other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations,
      falsifications, or material omissions may result in termination of employment.
    </p>

    <h2 id="1-5">1.5 Employment Relationship</h2>
    <p>
      You enter into employment voluntarily, and you are free to resign at any time for any reason or no
      reason. Similarly, SymTec is free to conclude its relationship with any employee at any time for any
      reason or no reason.
